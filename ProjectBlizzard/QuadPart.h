/**
This class represents a binary partition along the x axis. This class
has an accompanying class called BinTreeWith which utilises this
class to provide a binary tree implementation that can be used to 
increase efficiency of collision detection where there is a large
number of objects. <br>

It should be simple enough to create a QuadPartition or OcPartition
(for use in quadtrees or octrees) based on the code/algorithms in 
this class. <br>

Do not use 'delete' to release the dynamic memory used for the
partitions rather as they will be deleted when the parent BinTree is 
deleted. <br>

This class does not release the dynamic memory used for the objects
in the tree. <br>
