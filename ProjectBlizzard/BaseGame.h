/**
This is the parent class for any Game class and performs the actions 
associated with OpenGL and is used to create the game window.  <br>

Your Game class should inherit from this class and provide all the game
specific actions eg creating the game objects and perform the game logic <br>

Although we are using inheritance we are not supporting polymorphism. <br>

This class supports both 2D and 3D games, by default it is set to 3D but for
a 2D game you should call Set2D() before entering the main game loop. <br>

You can also use the Set3D and Set2D methods to create a 2D HUD or status
display.

DO NOT MODIFY THIS CLASS - INHERIT FROM IT AND OVERRIDE 
THESE METHODS IF NECCESSARY FOR YOUR PROGRAM
